# Task Specification: Geolocation Points Processing System

## Project Overview

Develop a web-based application for processing, grouping, and exporting geolocation point data from multiple text files. The system should provide surveyors and GIS professionals with an efficient tool to consolidate point data from various sources while maintaining data integrity and providing flexible export options.

## Background

Survey teams often work with multiple data files containing geolocation points from different measurement sessions or equipment. These files may contain overlapping data, use different naming conventions, and require manual processing to create consolidated datasets. The current manual process is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. File Import System

**FR-001: Multiple File Import**
- The system SHALL support importing multiple `.txt` files simultaneously
- The system SHALL process each file independently 
- The system SHALL allow users to add additional files after initial import
- The system SHALL prevent duplicate file imports using filename and file size detection

**FR-002: File Validation**
- The system SHALL validate file size limits (maximum 10MB per file)
- The system SHALL detect and handle empty files gracefully
- The system SHALL provide user feedback for invalid or problematic files
- The system SHALL log processing errors to browser console for debugging

**FR-003: Data Format Support**
- The system SHALL parse point data in the format: `NAME COORDINATE_X COORDINATE_Y COORDINATE_Z`
- The system SHALL support both space and semicolon separators between coordinates
- The system SHALL handle mixed separator formats within the same file
- The system SHALL support positive and negative coordinate values
- The system SHALL validate that coordinate values are valid numbers

### 2. Data Grouping System

**FR-004: Automatic Point Grouping**
The system SHALL automatically group points based on the following naming patterns:

- **4-digit numeric names** (e.g., `1053`, `8999`): Group as `1xxx`, `8xxx`, etc.
- **P-prefixed names** (e.g., `P91`, `P9123`): Group as `Pxx`
- **FP complex names** (e.g., `FP.N1.169.2`, `FP.U1.100.1`, `FP.N12.185.1`): Group by first two parts (`FP.N1`, `FP.U1`, `FP.N12`)
- **All other names**: Group by first part up to first dot or dash separator

**FR-005: Flexible Naming Support**
- The system SHALL support names of any length and complexity
- The system SHALL treat both dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`) as grouping separators
- The system SHALL handle alphanumeric combinations with special characters
- The system SHALL support multi-digit pattern variations (e.g., `FP.N12`, `FP.U23`)

### 3. User Interface Requirements

**FR-006: File Management Interface**
- The system SHALL display each imported file separately with its groups
- The system SHALL show group names with point counts for each group
- The system SHALL provide checkboxes for selective group export
- The system SHALL select all groups by default upon file import

**FR-007: Export Control Interface**
- The system SHALL provide a single export button for all selected groups
- The system SHALL only enable export when files are loaded
- The system SHALL provide visual feedback during processing
- The system SHALL display formatted output in a text area

**FR-008: Responsive Design**
- The system SHALL work on both desktop and mobile browsers
- The system SHALL provide an intuitive interface requiring no training
- The system SHALL use modern web standards without requiring plugins

### 4. Data Processing Requirements

**FR-009: Deduplication System**
- The system SHALL remove duplicate points based on point names
- The system SHALL preserve only the first occurrence of each unique point name
- The system SHALL handle duplicates across multiple files and groups
- The system SHALL maintain data integrity during deduplication

**FR-010: Sorting and Organization**
- The system SHALL sort final output alphabetically by point name
- The system SHALL use natural sorting (handling numeric sequences correctly)
- The system SHALL maintain consistent ordering across exports

### 5. Output Formatting Requirements

**FR-011: Consistent Formatting**
- The system SHALL format output with consistent column alignment
- The system SHALL use 13-space indentation for all point names
- The system SHALL maintain 7-space separation between coordinate columns
- The system SHALL automatically calculate optimal column widths based on data

**FR-012: Export Functionality**
- The system SHALL generate downloadable text files
- The system SHALL use filename `exported_points.txt` by default
- The system SHALL preserve coordinate precision from original data
- The system SHALL format output suitable for import into GIS software

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

**NFR-001: Processing Speed**
- The system SHALL process files up to 10MB within 30 seconds
- The system SHALL remain responsive during large file processing
- The system SHALL handle up to 10,000 points efficiently

**NFR-002: Memory Management**
- The system SHALL implement file size limits to prevent browser crashes
- The system SHALL efficiently handle multiple large files simultaneously
- The system SHALL provide garbage collection for processed data

### Reliability Requirements

**NFR-003: Error Handling**
- The system SHALL gracefully handle malformed input data
- The system SHALL continue processing when encountering invalid lines
- The system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
- The system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting

**NFR-004: Data Integrity**
- The system SHALL preserve coordinate precision from source files
- The system SHALL maintain point name accuracy throughout processing
- The system SHALL ensure no data loss during grouping and deduplication

### Usability Requirements

**NFR-005: User Experience**
- The system SHALL require no installation or configuration
- The system SHALL work entirely within web browsers
- The system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all operations
- The system SHALL use clear, professional interface design

**NFR-006: Accessibility**
- The system SHALL work on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- The system SHALL be keyboard accessible
- The system SHALL work without internet connectivity after initial load
